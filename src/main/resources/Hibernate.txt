Hibernate
Framework
- is an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM)
solution for Java environments.
-- The term ORM refers to the technique of mapping data between an object model
representation to a relational data model representation.

Takes care of
mapping from    Classes => Tables
        Java data types => SQL data types

Provides
  - data query
  - retrieval facilities

Hibernate Interfaces
    - SessionFactory
      *a thread safe (and immutable) representation of the mapping of the application domain model
       to a database;
      *very expensive to create;
      *for any given database, the application should have only one associated SessionFactory
      *maintains services that Hibernate uses across all Session(s).
    - The EntityManagerFactory
      = JPA equivalent => SessionFactory
      basically those two converge into the same SessionFactory implementation.
    - Session
      *single threaded, short lived object conceptually
       modeling a "Unit of Work";
      *JPA nomenclature - is represented by an EntityManager
      *wraps a JDBC Connection
      *acts as a factory for Transaction instances
    - Transaction
      *single threaded, short lived object
      *used to demarcate individual physical transaction boundaries
    - EntityTransaction
      *is the JPA equivalent
      *both act as an abstraction API to isolate the application
      from the underlying transaction system in use (JDBC or JTA)
