Hibernate
Framework
- is an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM)
solution for Java environments.
-- The term ORM refers to the technique of mapping data between an object model
representation to a relational data model representation.

Takes care of
mapping from    Classes => Tables
        Java data types => SQL data types

Provides
  - data query
  - retrieval facilities

Hibernate Interfaces
    - SessionFactory
      *a thread safe (and immutable) representation of the mapping of the application domain model
       to a database;
      *very expensive to create;
      *for any given database, the application should have only one associated SessionFactory
      *maintains services that Hibernate uses across all Session(s).
    - The EntityManagerFactory
      = JPA equivalent => SessionFactory
      basically those two converge into the same SessionFactory implementation.
    - Session
      *single threaded, short lived object conceptually
       modeling a "Unit of Work";
      *JPA nomenclature - is represented by an EntityManager
      *wraps a JDBC Connection
      *acts as a factory for Transaction instances
    - Transaction
      *single threaded, short lived object
      *used to demarcate individual physical transaction boundaries
    - EntityTransaction
      *is the JPA equivalent
      *both act as an abstraction API to isolate the application
      from the underlying transaction system in use (JDBC or JTA)

Hibernate - Domain model
     - is the central character in an ORM
     - Hibernate works best if these classes follow the Plain Old Java Object /
      JavaBean programming model
        = ordinary Java object
          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object
          *It is an ordinary Java object, not bound by any special restriction other than those
            forced by the Java Language Specification and not requiring any class path. POJOs are
            used for increasing the readability and re-usability of a program.
     - Hibernate understands both the Java and JDBC representations of application data
     - the function of a Hibernate type
        = The ability to read/write this data from/to the database
