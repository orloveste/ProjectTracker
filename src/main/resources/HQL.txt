HQL Frameworks
source: https://www.codejava.net/frameworks/hibernate/hibernate-query-language-hql-example
The Hibernate ORM framework provides its own query language called Hibernate Query Language.
It is very powerful and flexible and has the following
    characteristics:
- SQL similarity: syntax is very similar.
    from SELECT, FROM, ORDERBY to arithmetic expressions and aggregate functions, etc.
- Fully object-oriented:
    HQL doesnâ€™t use real names of table and columns.
    -//- uses class and property names instead.
    -//- can understand inheritance, polymorphism and association.
- Case-insensitive for keYwoRds - like SQL
    ex: SELECT, select or Select are the same
- Case-sensitive for Java classes and properties
    ex: Person and person are two different objects
